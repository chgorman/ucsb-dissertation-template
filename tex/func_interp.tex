\chapter{Examples of MSN Function Interpolation}
\label{chap:func_interp}

In this chapter we present results using the fast MSN algorithms.
We begin by interpolating smooth functions before
attempting to interpolate rough functions (discontinuous functions
or functions with infinite derivatives).
Unless otherwise stated, all computations will be performed
in double precision.
In 1D, we compare the results with Lagrange interpolation on
Chebyshev nodes.
In 2D, we will compare MSN with interpolation on a tensor grid of
Chebyshev nodes; this is computed using the 2D IDCT.
When comparing against rough functions, we use some standard
filters (discussed below).
