\chapter{Fast Algorithms for ODEs}
\label{chap:fast_ode}

In this chapter we shift from interpolation problems to differential equations,
the main goal of the dissertation.
Interpolation problems look at
function and derivative constraints at points of interest.
Naturally, linear differential equations involve linear combinations
of function and derivative values.

It is well-known that all differential equations can be rewritten
to into first-order system~\cite{petzoldODEs,ascherBVPs}.
While this is not always done, especially for finite
difference~\cite{levequeFDMs} or finite element methods~\cite{brennerFEMs},
we do in this case. This was also done when solving partial differential
equations with MSN~\cite{msnPDE}.
