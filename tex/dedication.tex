\noindent When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, \\
\indent    the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, \\
\noindent what is man that you are mindful of him, \\
\indent    and the son of man that you care for him? \\
\noindent --- Psalm 8:3--4

For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth,
    visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions
    or rulers or authorities -- all things were created through him
    and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things
    hold together. \\
\noindent --- Colossians 1:16--17
