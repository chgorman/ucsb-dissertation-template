Graduate school has been a long and difficult road,
and there are many people I would like to thank, not all of whom
can be listed here.
Without their help and support, I would not have graduated.

First and foremost, I would like to thank my doctoral committee:
Shiv Chandrasekaran, Xu Yang, Hector Ceniceros, and Sherry Li.
Shiv, you have been a great help through the entire process
as I studied numerical linear algebra and fast algorithms,
always reminding me about numerical stability and floating point arithmetic.
Xu, thank you for teaching me about partial differential equations
and asymptotic analysis.
I am so glad to have both Shiv and Xu as doctoral advisors.
Hector, thank you for teaching me about finite difference methods
and pushing me to clearly articulate my results.
Sherry, it was great to spend two summers working on STRUMPACK with you,
Pieter, Gustavo, and Yang at Berkeley Lab.
I learned a lot about computing, randomization,
and software and algorithm development.

During my six years at UCSB, I have gained many friends.
Those who have been with me from the beginning: Nancy, Steve, Jay, and Kyle.
I have had a great time with you all.
Those in Shiv's group: Kristen, Abhejit, Nithin, and Ethan.
It has been great to know you while learning from Shiv.
Medina, thank you for all the work you do in the Mathematics Department.

While living in Santa Barbara, I have gained many friends
and mentors at Good Shepherd Lutheran Church.
These include Pastor and Kitty; Ted and Andrea; and Chuck and Lois.
Thank you for teaching me about life outside of school and work.

Thank you for the many friends I made in Reformed University Fellowship
(RUF) at UCSB.
Thank you especially to Johnathan (and Jaimeson) for leading RUF.
You and Grace show God's love in Jesus to people on campus.
Evan: it has been great to have another graduate student who is
going through the same process.
Nathan and Stanley: it has been great to get to know you both these past
few years.

Thank you to my family and especially my parents:
Dad and Lin, and Mom and Paul.
In particular, I must thank Vince and Megan:
it has been great to get to know you and spend
time with your family these years, especially Joe and Alice.
Joe, you have been a great mentor and helped me early on
in my doctoral program by encouraging me to recognize
my dissertation is not the end, but rather the beginning, of my work.

My twin brother James: It was great going to Wabash College with
you. Working on mathematics and physics homework late at night
helped us succeed as undergraduates and continue on to earn our doctorates.
Thank you for being my best friend.
