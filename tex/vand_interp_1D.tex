\chapter{\CV{} Matrices and Factorizations for 1D Interpolation}
\label{chap:CV_mat_1D_I}

Using structured matrices from Chapter~\ref{chap:K_and_R},
we investigate Chebyshev-Vandermonde matrices
in 1D and use this information to construct
fast algorithms for interpolation problems.
These factorizations will allow us to quickly compute
the MSN solution to interpolation and differential equations
(discussed later in Chapter~\ref{chap:fast_ode}).
