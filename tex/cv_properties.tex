\chapter{Properties of Cheby\-shev-Vander\-monde Ma\-trices}
\label{chap:CV_Prop}

In this chapter we discuss properties of Chebyshev polynomials
and Chebyshev-Vander\-monde (C\-/V) matrices that we will
use in later chapters to develop fast algorithms for
solving interpolation and differential equations.
