\chapter{Notation Convention, Structured Rotations, and Kronecker Products}
\label{chap:K_and_R}

We begin with some notation conventions before reviewing
standard orthogonal matrices and
looking at the Kronecker product and how it affects fast matrix-vector
multiplication. One standard reference for matrix-related topics is~\cite{gvl4}.
These topics will then be used to look at
matrix factorizations of Chebyshev-Vandermonde (C\=/V) matrices
in Chapters~\ref{chap:CV_mat_1D_I} and \ref{chap:CV_mat_HD_I}.
